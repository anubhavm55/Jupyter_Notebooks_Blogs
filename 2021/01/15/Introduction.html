<p>Recently I came across a deep learning course that has changed my life forever!!! I am talking about fast.ai’s<a href="https://fast.ai">FastAI</a> “Practical Deep Learning for Coders”.</p>
<h2 id="first-misunderstanding-deep-learning-only-for-phds">First misunderstanding: Deep Learning only for PhDs</h2>

<p>I started deep learning in my 3rd semester minor project(currently in 6th semester) and I went through a lot of courses on youtube and coursera. At first, it was very exciting to know the maths behind all of this but when I tried to implement it I was unable to do so. I found myself searching tutorials and guides for tensorflow, keras, pytorch but nothing made sense. I was frustrated as I was unable to implement something which I understood. For example, the project that I was working on had the equation for the prediction as<br />
y(m,t) = Σσ<sub>1</sub>(b+m<em>e<sup>w1</sup>) * σ<sub>2</sub>(b-t</em>e<sup>w2</sup>) * e<sup>w3</sup><br />
where σ<sub>1</sub> is softplus function and σ<sub>2</sub> is a sigmoid function.<br />
The above equation clearly states that I have to create all these layers from scratch since all the predefined models do computation of the form b+(some input)*w. Making above architecture seemed so difficult to me and I came to the conclusion that only PhDs understood intricacies of deep learning. So, at last I went to tensorflow keras tutorial, randomly added lots of dense and embedding(lol, it didn’t require any embedding layer, I didn’t even know back then what an embedding layer was) layers for this model, got an accuracy so bad(mape of 1 lakh) and lost all interest in deep learning.</p>

<h2 id="second-misunderstanding-more-epochs-means-more-accuracy">Second misunderstanding: More epochs means more accuracy</h2>
<p>I remember I used to train the above model for 250 epochs(lmao, its funny now that I know) and leave my laptop for hours thinking that the error would decrease. After taking the fast.ai course, I’ve come across exceptional accuracy by training for only 3 epochs. That is why 250 seems a very large number.</p>

<p>So that was my introduction to deep learning which was not very pleasant as evident.</p>
